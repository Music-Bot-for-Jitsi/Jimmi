# :robot: Who is Jimmi?

Do you remember [JIM](https://github.com/p-fruck/jim/)? The Jitsi Integrated Musicbot?

I am Jimmi! Your Jitsi Integrated Musicbot Management Interface.

# :tada: How does Jimmi help me?

An awesome Jitsi Meet Party has never been so easy! - Go to [jimmi.xyz](https://jimmi.xyz/) fill in the party location and start listening to your music with your friends!

:warning: Remember that you have to install the browser extension before. See below for how to install.

# :sparkles: Features

At the moment Jimmi only supports simple music playback but he already has an extension system which offers much room for improvement. For the beginning, this is how music playback looks like in the management interface:

# :rocket: Get started!

Caused by the [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) restrictions you need a browser extension to load external YouTube videos into your session and, depending on their configuration, connect to a foreign Jitsi instance.

There have been approaches to circumvent this CORS issues, e.g. the [v2 release of Jimmi](https://github.com/Music-Bot-for-Jitsi/Jimmi/releases/tag/v2.0.0) that you can treet like an April Fool because it was unmaintainable and very resource intensive. For the sake of simplicity and security, it has been decided to deal with the CORS restrictions using the declarativeNetRequest feature of Manifest V3.

Jimmi should support all browsers supporting Manifest V3. If your browser doesn't work, feel free to submit an issue.

## Installation

Installation of the extension depends on your browser and is easiest in Chromium/Google Chrome which is explained below:

1. Call [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) in your browser
2. On the right hand side of the navigation bar activate the *Developer mode*
3. Then press *Load unpacked*
4. Select the `browser` folder
5. Navigate to [jimmi.xyz](https://jimmi.xyz/) and let the party begin!
